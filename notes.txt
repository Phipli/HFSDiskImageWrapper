Need PHP installed
Make sure there is a folder called "uploads" in the same directory with the correct permissions.

To start a development test server on linux (or similar), navigate to the folder in the commandline and
type :
php -S localhost:1984
You can then use a web browser to access the test server by entering the url "localhost:1984"

Command to remove folders older than 20 minutes :
sudo find /sharedfolders/macimagefolder/uploads/ -maxdepth 1 -mmin +20 -type d -exec rm -r {} \;
